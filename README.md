- **Adaptive UI System**: Detects **device type, OS, UI preferences, and screen settings** to adjust UI dynamically.
- **Memetic Feedback Loop (MFL)**: Continuously **learns from user behavior to refine UI interactions**.
- **AI-Language Model Fusion**: Enhances **AI response accuracy** and **personalized UX**.
- **Trust & Ethics Module**: Ensures **AI transparency and user control over UI adaptations**.
